In one of my last articles I have written about my new challenge. To be a speaker at a conference. This happened two times at local editions of 4Developers in Krakow and in Katowice. It was for me interesting experience, especially that this audience doesn't know Ruby as programming language too well. I had a chance to share my knowledge about Ruby and good programming practices with them. In the near future there are going to be two more local editions of 4Developers. And because of that I have a surprise for you which is prepared together with 4Developers organizers. I have for you a discount for these two events and one free ticket which you can win. But let's start from the beginning.

<!--break-->

4Developers is a conference where the main edition took a place in April in Warsaw this year (2019). This is an event which brings over 2,000 participants interested in the IT world to one place. It doesn't matter if you are working in Python, JavaScript, PHP or any other technology. There were 14 paths related to different topics like cloud computing, data science, mobile or even soft skills. After this one big event there are smaller local editions, which have similar structure. Different topics on different paths, but each local event has its own atmosphere. Krakow and Katowice already had their local events. You can find more about them in my previous article about <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/4developers-2019" title='4Developers 2019'>4Developers</a>. Now we are waiting for Wroclaw 5th of November and Poznan 18th of November. The end of this IT marathon will be in Gdansk on 27th of November where will take a place 4Developers OFFLINE will take a place.
