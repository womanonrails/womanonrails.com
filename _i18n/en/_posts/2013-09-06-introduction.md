  Let's start blog's adventure. Feel free to read!

  I think that my first post should be original and interesting, but also feminine.
  I hit on an idea to create recipe.
  Well, my cooking skills are none too good so the recipe will be short.

  Take a **Ruby on Rails** baking tin.
  Then add **Ruby**, **HTML 5** and little piece of **JavaScript** into it.
  Mix all ingredients together and add **CSS** icing.
  Finally our new application is ready.
  Fast, easy, and with lot of fun.

  I would like to divide my blog entries to some categories...

Let's start blog's adventure. Feel free to read!

I think that my first post should be original and interesting, but also feminine. I hit on an idea to create recipe. Well, my cooking skills are none too good so the recipe will be short.

I would like to divide my blog entries to some categories. I will write not only about Ruby and Rails, but also about other programming languages. I will mention great articles, books and web pages. But I will test them first on my own. Of course I’ll leave some space to talk about testing. I will also write few words about key shortcuts. I really like it and I use them all the time. And last, but not least thing – code refactoring. It’s very useful.

I really enjoyed writing this for you. Have a great time.

See you next time. For now I go to Poznan. I’ll be learning Ruby on Rails with others girls on Rails Girls meeting. I can’t wait for it!

Bye and see you soon ;*
