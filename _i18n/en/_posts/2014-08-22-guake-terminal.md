Today, I would love to share with you a very simple, but useful tool. I use it for years now, and I think it is irreplaceable. This is {% include links/external-link.html name='Guake' url='http://guake-project.org/' %} terminal.

## What is Guake?

It is a drop-down terminal for Linux with **GNOME** Desktop Environment. When you use **KDE** Desktop Environment, you can check the Yakuake terminal. It's similar to Guake. OK, but I don’t know which Desktop Environment I use? By default, GNOME is used by systems such as Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint. So, if you use any of those Linux distributions, you probably use GNOME.

## Advantages of Guake

Guake is a simple tool. After you download and install Guake, you can start using this tool. Then whenever you press the `F12` key, you will see the terminal on the top of your screen. Press `F12` key again, the terminal will be gone.

This terminal is very useful. It is available all the time. When you press the `F12` key, it will pop up again. Besides that, you can open many tabs on Guake. I work on Guake with 3 or 4 tabs. First for server, second for Ruby console, third for git, and last one for running tests.

I like this tool very much. Especially, after I configured it to launch with a system. I don't need to think about running the terminal anymore. I just press `F12` key, and that's it. In a fast and easy way, I have access to all my open terminal tabs. And most important, I can use Guake without a mouse, using only the keyboard. It's very important to me when I use a laptop where I have only the touchpad.
