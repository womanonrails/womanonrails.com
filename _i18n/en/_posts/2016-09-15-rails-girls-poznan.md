Summer is almost gone and I'm back on **Rails Girls** journey. This time I went to **Rails Girls Poznań**. And to be honest, the weather during this workshop was so nice, like it was still summer even in September. Poznań is a very special place for me. If you don't know yet, here was my first Rails Girls event and I was a participant back then. I wrote an article <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/rails-girls-rules" title="Rails Girls Poznań - Me as a participant">Rails Girls Rules</a> about my first experience with Rails Girls initiative. It was in 2013. How fast the time flies, don't you think?

This year I was already on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/rails-girls-warsaw-2016" title="Rails Girls Warsaw - video story">Rails Girls Warsaw</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/rails-girls-lodz" title="Rails Girls Łódź - video story">Rails Girls Łódź</a> workshops. And there will be one more, very special - <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/rails-girls-cieszyn" title="Rails Girls Cieszyn">Rails Girls in Cieszyn</a>. I will tell you more about it later ;] Now you can check my video from this year Rails Girls workshops in Poznań. Unfortunately, all what I say and all titles are in Polish. I hope you don't mind. Have a nice time watching it!
