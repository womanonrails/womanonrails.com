Summer is almost gone and I'm back on **Rails Girls** journey. This time I went to **Rails Girls Poznań**. And to be honest, the weather during this workshop was so nice, like it was still summer even in September. Poznań is a very special place for me. If you don't know yet, here was my first Rails Girls event and I was a participant back then. I wrote an article [Rails Girls Rules]({{site.baseurl}}/rails-girls-rules "Rails Girls Poznań - Me as a participant") about my first experience with Rails Girls initiative. It was in 2013. How fast the time flies, don't you think?

This year I was already on [Rails Girls Warsaw]({{site.baseurl}}/rails-girls-warsaw-2016 "Rails Girls Warsaw - video story") and [Rails Girls Łódź]({{site.baseurl}}/rails-girls-lodz "Rails Girls Łódź - video story") workshops. And there will be one more, very special - [Rails Girls in Cieszyn]({{site.baseurl}}/rails-girls-cieszyn "Rails Girls Cieszyn"). I will tell you more about it later ;] Now you can check my video from this year Rails Girls workshops in Poznań. Unfortunately, all what I say and all titles are in Polish. I hope you don't mind. Have a nice time watching it!
