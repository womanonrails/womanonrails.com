I'm really a Rails Girls freak! After a weekend with [Rails Girls Warsaw]({{site.baseurl}}/rails-girls-warsaw-2016 "Rails Girls Warsaw - video story"), I went to the next workshops. This time, I was in Łódź on the third edition of **Rails Girls Łódź**. I loved the atmosphere of this workshop. It is always a pleasure for me to share my knowledge and to see that other women want to try new things.

As usually, workshops started on Friday. We set up the environment on girls' laptops and discussed what they would like to create during the workshops. After this installation party, was a dinner for mentors. This is a special time for us to talk a little bit about challenges for the next day of workshops. On Saturday, as usual, we started early in the morning just after a breakfast. There was a time for learning and coding. In the afternoon, after lunch, we all watched short lighting talks. They are great to inspire and show possibilities in IT. During those special workshops we also had a possibility to connect with other Rails Girls workshops which took a place at the same time but in a different country! I'm really grateful that I can be a part of the Rails Girls community.

This year there will be even more Rails Girls events where I will appear. And one of them will be a very special one, so stay tuned!

In the meantime, you can watch video from Rails Girls Łódź. Bye!
